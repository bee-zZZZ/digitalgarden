Previously, I used [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader)'s notes and highlight export function to export as markdown and store them in my Obsidian vault (I've contributed to its development too). I export with styles so that they give me context later. It is very convenient. However, sometimes, it is also hard to read. In Obsidian we have [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts) which are not standard markdown, and therefore, is not a good candidate to add support for it in the KOReader directly. So I decided to export as JSON from KOReader and use that JSON to generate markdown the way I like.

I'm using the script below to achieve my goal. Save this as a template and call it with the [Templater plugin](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).

```js
<%*
const NOTE_STYLES = {
  yellow: {
	type: "quote",
	title: "Quotable/Concept/General Idea",
  },
  blue: {
	type: "important",
	title: "Striking/Intense",
  },
  red: {
	type: "danger",
	title: "In Discord",
  },
  green: {
	type: "question",
	title: "Thought Provoking",
  },
  orange: {
    type: "warning",
    title: "Unsound"
  },
  purple: {
    type: "stylish",
    title: "Stylish"
  }
};

function format_koreader_percentages(page, total) {
	if (page && total) {
		return `${((page / total) * 100).toFixed(2)}%`;
	}
	return "";
}

function format_koreader_json_highlights(content) {
	const data = JSON.parse(content);
    let output = `---\ntitle: "${data.title}"\naliases: ["Notes from ${data.title}"]\nauthor: "${data.author}"\n---\n# ${data.title}\n##### ${data.author}`;

	let current_chapter = "";
	for (const entry of data.entries) {
	  if (entry.text) {
		if (entry.chapter != current_chapter) {
		  output += `\n\n## ${entry.chapter}\n`;
		  current_chapter = entry.chapter;
		}
		output += `\n### Page: ${
		  entry.page
		} (${format_koreader_percentages(
		  entry.page,
		  data.number_of_pages
		)}) @ ${window.moment.unix(entry.time).format("DD MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss A")}\n`;
		output += `\n${entry.text}`;
		const note_type = NOTE_STYLES[entry.color];
		output += `\n\n> [!${note_type.type}] ${note_type.title}`;
		if (entry.note) {
		  if (entry.note.length > 50) {
			output += `\n> ${entry.note}`;
		  } else {
			output += `: ${entry.note}`;
		  }
		  output += "\n";
		}
		output += "\n";
	  }
	}
	return output;
}

const content = await tp.system.prompt("Paste the JSON content", null, true, true);
const output = format_koreader_json_highlights(content);
let file = app.workspace.getActiveFile();
await app.vault.modify(file, output);
%>
```

Lines 23-26 use a [custom callout](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts) defined with the following CSS:

```css
.callout[data-callout="stylish"] {
    --callout-color: var(--color-purple-rgb);
    --callout-icon: lucide-brush;
}
```

### An Example
Here's an exported JSON file I used to generate a note from:

```json
{
    "entries": [
        {
            "text": "He was wrong. Very understandably so, since reality, even if it is inevitable, is not completely predictable; those who learn some correct detail about the life of another promptly jump from it to quite incorrect conclusions and see in the newly discovered fact the explanation for things which in truth are completely unrelated to it.",

            "page": 22,
            "chapter": "The Prisoner"
        },
        {
            "text": "The things people joke about most are usually those which irritate them, but which they do not want to seem to be irritated by; there is perhaps, too, an unspoken hope of further advantage: that the person we are speaking to, hearing us admit something jokingly, will believe that it is not true.",
            "time": 1723464653,
            "color": "yellow",
            "sort": "highlight",
            "drawer": "underscore",
            "page": 38,
            "chapter": "The Prisoner"
        },
        {
            "text": "No, approaching the sonata from another point of view, looking at it in itself as the work of a great artist, I was carried back on the wave of sound towards the old days at Combray – I do not mean Montjouvain and the Méséglise way, but our walks towards Guermantes – when I myself had wanted to be an artist. Having in practice abandoned this ambition, had I given up something real? Could life make up to me for the loss of art, or was there in art a deeper reality where our true personality finds an expression that the actions of life cannot give it? Each great artist seems so different from all the others, and gives us such a strong sense of individuality, which we seek in vain in everyday life!",
            "time": 1724727692,
            "color": "blue",
            "sort": "highlight",
            "drawer": "underscore",
            "page": 131,
            "chapter": "The Prisoner"
        },
        {
            "text": "But despite the richness of these works, in which the contemplation of nature is found next to action, next to individuals who are not only the names of characters, I found myself thinking how strongly these works partake of the character of being – wonderfully, it is true – incomplete: that incompleteness which characterizes all the great works of the nineteenth century; the nineteenth century, whose greatest writers failed in their books, but, watching themselves at work as if they were both worker and judge, drew from this self-contemplation a new beauty, separate from and superior to their work, conferring on it retrospectively a unity, a grandeur which it does not have in reality.",
            "time": 1724727752,
            "color": "green",
            "sort": "highlight",
            "drawer": "underscore",
            "page": 132,
            "chapter": "The Prisoner"
        }
    ],
    "file": "/storage/emulated/0/Books/In Search of Lost Time/(In Search of Lost Time (Prendergast Edition) - 05) Marcel Proust - The Prisoner and The Fugitive.epub",
    "title": "The Prisoner and The Fugitive",

    "version": "json/1.0.0",
    "number_of_pages": 568,
    "author": "Marcel Proust"
}
```

And it generated the following content:

```

Very understandably so, since reality, even if it is inevitable, is not completely predictable; those who learn some correct detail about the life of another promptly jump from it to quite incorrect conclusions and see in the newly discovered fact the explanation for things which in truth are completely unrelated to it.

The things people joke about most are usually those which irritate them, but which they do not want to seem to be irritated by; there is perhaps, too, an unspoken hope of further advantage: that the person we are speaking to, hearing us admit something jokingly, will believe that it is not true.

No, approaching the sonata from another point of view, looking at it in itself as the work of a great artist, I was carried back on the wave of sound towards the old days at Combray – I do not mean Montjouvain and the Méséglise way, but our walks towards Guermantes – when I myself had wanted to be an artist. Having in practice abandoned this ambition, had I given up something real? Could life make up to me for the loss of art, or was there in art a deeper reality where our true personality finds an expression that the actions of life cannot give it? Each great artist seems so different from all the others, and gives us such a strong sense of individuality, which we seek in vain in everyday life!

But despite the richness of these works, in which the contemplation of nature is found next to action, next to individuals who are not only the names of characters, I found myself thinking how strongly these works partake of the character of being – wonderfully, it is true – incomplete: that incompleteness which characterizes all the great works of the nineteenth century; the nineteenth century, whose greatest writers failed in their books, but, watching themselves at work as if they were both worker and judge, drew from this self-contemplation a new beauty, separate from and superior to their work, conferring on it retrospectively a unity, a grandeur which it does not have in reality.

## Before Version 2024.08

Before the aforementioned version, there was no support for colour in highlights. Back then I used to do the same using the 4 **styles** provided by KOReader. Here's the script to do just that. 

```js
<%*
// The KOReader defined highlight styles vs callout mapping. Leave the keys as is, but you can edit the values to create your own convention.
const NOTE_STYLES = {
  lighten: {
	type: "quote",
	title: "Quotable/Concept/General Idea",
  },
  invert: {
	type: "important",
	title: "Striking/Intense",
  },
  strikeout: {
	type: "danger",
	title: "In Discord",
  },
  underscore: {
	type: "question",
	title: "Thought Provoking",
  },
};

function format_koreader_percentages(page, total) {
	if (page && total) {
		return `${((page / total) * 100).toFixed(2)}%`;
	}
	return "";
}

function format_koreader_json_highlights(content) {
	const data = JSON.parse(content);
    let output = `---
title: "${data.title}"
aliases: ["Notes from ${data.title}"]
author: "${data.author}"
---
# ${data.title}
##### ${data.author}`;
	let current_chapter = "";
	for (const entry of data.entries) {
	  if (entry.text) {
		if (entry.chapter != current_chapter) {
		  output += `\n\n## ${entry.chapter}\n`;
		  current_chapter = entry.chapter;
		}
		output += `\n### Page: ${
		  entry.page
		} (${format_koreader_percentages(
		  entry.page,
		  data.number_of_pages
		)}) @ ${window.moment.unix(entry.time).format("DD MMM YYYY hh:mm:ss A")}\n`;
		output += `\n${entry.text}`;
		const note_type = NOTE_STYLES[entry.drawer];
		output += `\n\n> [!${note_type.type}] ${note_type.title}`;
		if (entry.note) {
		  if (entry.note.length > 50) {
			output += `\n> ${entry.note}`;
		  } else {
			output += `: ${entry.note}`;
		  }
		  output += "\n";
		}
		output += "\n";
	  }
	}
	return output;
}

const content = await tp.system.prompt("Paste the JSON content", null, true, true);
const output = format_koreader_json_highlights(content);
let file = app.workspace.getActiveFile();
await app.vault.modify(file, output);
%>
```

It will prompt you to paste the JSON. open the JSON file and copy-paste the content in the prompt.

### An Example
Here's an exported JSON file I used to generate a note from:

```json

	],
	"title": "The Sound of Water",
	"created_on": 1694256681,

```

And, It generated the following content:
